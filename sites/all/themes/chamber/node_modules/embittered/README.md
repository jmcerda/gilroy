embittered
==========

npm install Bitters publics

I wanted to use a package manager to install the bitters styles, so other people with Bitters can just type 'npm install' and get the latest versions of the bitters stylesheets.

To install type

  npm install embittered
  
Then make sure your node is serving embittered as a public folder.
